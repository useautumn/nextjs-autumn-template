# Next.js Autumn Starter Template

[Autumn](https://useautumn.com) is an open-source layer between Stripe and your application, allowing you to create any pricing model and embed it with a couple lines of code.

This template demonstrates how you can set up pricing in just 3 lines of code using Autumn. The example used is a simple AI chat message app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnyeocx/nextjs-autumn-template
```

2. Create an account at [app.useautumn.com](https://app.useautumn.com)

3. Get your Autumn secret key from the [sandbox environment](https://app.useautumn.com/sandbox/dev) and add it to `.env.local`:
```env
AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY=am_sk_test_OAFUOL0meFCjpMMmFeU13gHnrEOGAHWp2YTLECyY7k
```

4. Connect your Stripe account in the [integrations page](https://app.useautumn.com/sandbox/integrations/stripe)

## Understanding the Implementation

This template implements a simple AI chat message app where users can:
- Send messages (with usage limits)
- Upgrade to a pro plan
- View their usage and subscription details

### Key Endpoints

1. **Check feature access** (`/entitled`)
```typescript
// Check if user can send a message
const allowed = await entitled({
  customerId: CUSTOMER_ID,
  featureId: FEATURE_ID,
});

if (!allowed) {
  toast.error("You're out of messages!");
  return;
}
```

2. **Track usage** (`/events`)
```typescript
// Record that a message was sent
await sendEvent({
  customerId: CUSTOMER_ID,
  featureId: FEATURE_ID,
});
```

3. **Attach product to customer on purchase** (`/attach`)
```typescript
// Upgrade user to pro plan
const res = await attachProduct({
  customerId: CUSTOMER_ID,
  productId: "pro",
});
window.open(res.checkout_url, "_blank");
```

<!-- ### Additional Features

The template also includes `getOrCreateCustomer` to fetch customer details, entitlements, and subscription status, which is used in the customer details card in the UI:

```typescript
const customer = await getOrCreateCustomer(CUSTOMER_ID);
// Returns: customer details, product subscriptions, and feature entitlements
``` -->
